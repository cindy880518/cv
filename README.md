Cindy-PORTFOLIO 個人作品集／個人網站

I have been involved in many projects related to web/UI interface design. In the past 1 years, I have focused on UI/UX design logic, data application, exploring streamlined design and meaningful user experience.

I love teamwork and helping teams solve problems and accomplish goals together keeps my passion alive.
